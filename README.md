<h3>Description</h3> 
This Bot is a solution to search for programming courses on the internet. The application, programmed in Python and Flask, uses Selenium to perform searches in browsers such as Chrome or Firefox. In addition, it has an SQL database that records user interactions with the Bot, including the searches performed and the courses found. This way, you can determine which courses are the most popular and offer personalized suggestions to users in the future.
